#### 1a: The deliverable includes a web page that presents users with a search box, enabling them to enter a lineage ID or a sample. Arer clicking the submit buson, a zoomable pedigree tree is displayed on the ler side of the screen, providing a visual representation of the selected lineage ID or sample. The leaves of the pedigree tree are color-coded to signify whether they represent a "seed" or "harvest" event.
<br>

#### 1b: In the displayed pedigree tree obtained in 1a, seed leaves that exhibit at least three descending harvest events are indicated by a distinctive "growth curve" icon. Clicking on the icon reveals a menu. Selecting the "growth curve" option from the menu opens a pop-up window displaying the growth curve.
<br>

Clicking on the icon triggers a popup window, presenting a UMAP map for each available genotypic information, or a heatmap if genotypic information is not available at the single-cell resolution. If multiple genotypic information is accessible, webpage will contain several panes, such that users can view the tree, the phenotypic information (growth curve) and genotypic information all at the same time.

Upon clicking the icon, all seed leaves within the corresponding subtree are presented along a time-axis, where the x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis represents the number of days between the seed and the last harvest.
