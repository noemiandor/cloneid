Description: CLONEID has a three-tier architecture: a SQL database in the backend, a Java core and an R user interface. The database consists of tables associated with experimental and computational aspects of in-vitro studies. They come together to form two modules: the 1st keeps track of the pedigree of lineages grown in a lab and monitors changes in their phenotypes, such as growth rate via computer vision. The 2nd module links subclonal omics profiles from different high throughput assays to each other and to the phenotypes from the 1st module. CLONEID captures information for learning genotype-phenotype associations, but with an emphasis on monitoring phenotype over longer periods of time (i.e. phenotypic information has an additional temporal dimension). Perspective and Identity are SQL tables central to CLONEID's -omics module. They hold clone-specific profiles quantified with a given assay. For example, a clone's genome perspective may be inferred from exome-sequencing, while its transcriptome perspective may rely on single cell RNA sequencing. Entries in the SQL table Identity are clones that have been confirmed by at least two different assays (either same assay ran on biological replicates or different types of assays ran on the same cell sample).
