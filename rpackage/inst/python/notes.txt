Saeed Alahmari,

Fixed get_pixel_size.py to get the pixel size using two methods of enhancement to the image: 1) histogram equalization (if it fails) then 2) resizing. 
Also, I added the image that could not be processed for reading the text and calculating the pixel_size to the end of the queue. 
Also, I have added a logging for the errors and the messages to the directory named log, where the each run is saved with the date and time name.txt
Also, if the same image is processed three times, and was not able to get the correct pixel size for, then the code exit.
